Yes — you can give users a truly “no‑code” install by having them point their DNS at your overlay service, which will proxy their site and inject your UI on the fly. Here’s a high‑level design:

1. Why pure DNS + UI injection needs a proxy
* DNS only maps names → IPs, it can’t itself add scripts to HTML.
* If you host their domain through your servers (via an A‑record or CNAME), you can fetch their real site, inject your overlay code, then serve it back—no site‑owner code changes required.

2. Onboarding flow
1. User enters their domain (e.g. www.acme.com) in your dashboard.
2. Your system automatically:
    * Generates a reverse‑proxy route for that hostname.
    * Boots up an NGINX/Node service that will fetch www.acme.com upstream.
    * Prepares an SSL/TLS certificate (via Let’s Encrypt) for that hostname.
3. You tell the user: “Please add a CNAME record pointing www.acme.com → your‑overlay‑gateway.com (or an A record to our IP at 12.34.56.78). Once DNS propagates, all traffic to www.acme.com will be routed through our overlay service—no further code needed.” 
4. Once DNS is live, your gateway:
    * Proxies every request to the real origin (the original www.acme.com server).
    * Parses the HTML response and injects your chatbot & UI overlay snippet just before </body>.
    * Streams it back over HTTPS to the user’s visitors.

3. Technical components
Piece	What it does
DNS record	User points their domain at your gateway
Overlay gateway	Reverse‑proxy + HTML injector
SSL provisioning	Automatic Let’s Encrypt certs
Injection script	Your chatbot CSS/JS snippet
Dashboard UI	User enters domain, sees “Install complete”

4. Advantages & trade‑offs
* ✅ Truly zero‑code for your customer.
* ✅ You fully control the injection logic—easy to update UI globally.
* ⚠️ Must handle SSL, scaling, and origin‑fetch performance on your servers.
* ⚠️ Root domains (apex) may require ALIAS/ANAME support rather than simple CNAME.

5. Example: Cloudflare Workers alternative
If you don’t want to run your own servers, you can leverage Cloudflare Workers:
1. User points their domain at your Cloudflare account (via NS change).
2. You deploy a Worker script that fetches their origin and resp.text() → injects your UI → returns it.
3. Cloudflare manages the DNS, SSL, and scaling for you.

Summary
* Yes it’s possible, but you need a reverse‑proxy layer or a CDN/Worker in front of their site.
* Users only touch DNS—no HTML/JS editing on their side.
* You handle the injection, SSL/day‑to‑day operations, and versioning of the overlay UI.
